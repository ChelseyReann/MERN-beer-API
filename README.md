# Full Stack Brewery Application

## Introduction
Using an API that one of my fellow classmates created, I created a Front-End application! It's all about breweries in different states and you can view their website, location, and phone number. 

I implemented a slider functionality so you can scroll through each brewery. This is also a full CRUD application! User's can create their own entry for a brewery that isn't on the list! Also, user's can update the brewery's phone number if it isn't correct and users can also delete a brewery entry from the list!

## Installation
1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies using the below command.
```
npm i
```
3. Once the dependecies are downloaded you can check out the site on your local server by running the below command.
```
npm run start
```
4. Happy coding!
